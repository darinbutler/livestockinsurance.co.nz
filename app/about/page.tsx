            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Who We Are</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              LivestockInsurance.co.nz is an independent livestock insurance comparison and referral service operated by the Cover4You Group. We exist to help farmers find the right insurance cover for their livestock — without the pressure of dealing directly with a single insurer.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What We Do</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              We connect farmers and livestock owners with licensed rural insurance advisers who specialise in livestock and farm insurance. Our advisers compare providers including FMG, Aon, Gallagher, NZI, and specialist brokers to find the right cover for your situation.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              We are not a direct insurer and we do not sell insurance policies. We are an independent referral service. The advisers we connect you with hold current Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licences under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why We Exist</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Many farmers are significantly underinsured — either because they assume FMG covers everything, or because comparing providers is time-consuming. Events like Cyclone Gabrielle and the Mycoplasma bovis programme showed what happens when farmers discover their cover is inadequate.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Our goal is simple: make it easier for farmers to get the right livestock insurance, from the right provider, at the right price.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Our Service Is Free</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Our referral service is completely free to farmers. Licensed advisers earn a referral fee from the insurer when you take out a policy — you pay nothing extra for using our service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Part of the Cover4You Group</h2>
